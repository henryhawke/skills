# Cloud Infrastructure

## When to use
- Design cloud architecture (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Write Terraform/OpenTofu modules
- Set up Kubernetes clusters and GitOps
- Configure service mesh (Istio, Linkerd)
- Design hybrid/multi-cloud solutions
- Optimize cloud networking and costs

## Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform: modules, state management, workspaces
- OpenTofu, AWS CDK, Pulumi
- Policy as Code (OPA, Sentinel)
- GitOps workflows

## Kubernetes
- EKS/AKS/GKE cluster design
- ArgoCD/Flux for GitOps
- Progressive delivery (canary, blue-green)
- Multi-tenancy and RBAC
- Service mesh: Istio traffic management, Linkerd

## Networking
- VPC/VNet design and peering
- Zero-trust networking and mTLS
- Global load balancing and CDN
- VPN and dedicated connections
- SSL/TLS configuration

## Cost optimization
- Resource rightsizing
- Reserved instances and savings plans
- Tagging strategies
- FinOps practices
