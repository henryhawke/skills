# Developer Experience

## When to use
- Set up or optimize monorepo tooling
- Improve development workflows
- Configure build systems and caching
- Implement authentication patterns
- Design error handling strategies
- Advanced Git workflows

## Monorepo tools
- Turborepo: caching, pipelines, remote caching
- Nx: workspace configuration, project boundaries
- Bazel: build optimization, remote execution
- pnpm workspaces

## Patterns
- Authentication: JWT, OAuth2, session management, RBAC
- Error handling: Result types, error propagation, graceful degradation
- SQL optimization and EXPLAIN analysis
- Git: rebasing, cherry-picking, bisect, worktrees

## Quality
- Code review best practices
- E2E testing with Playwright/Cypress
- Debugging strategies and profiling
