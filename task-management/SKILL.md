# Task Management & Orchestration

## When to use
- Coordinate complex multi-step tasks
- Analyze task dependencies and parallelization
- Verify task implementations meet specifications
- Execute specific implementation tasks
- Manage task queues and priorities

## Workflow
1. Analyze task queue and dependency graph
2. Identify tasks that can run in parallel
3. Execute tasks respecting dependency order
4. Verify completed tasks meet requirements
5. Reassess queue as tasks complete
6. Report progress and blockers

## Quality checks
- Verify implementations against specifications
- Run tests for completed tasks
- Ensure best practices are followed
- Check for regressions
