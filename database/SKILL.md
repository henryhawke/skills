# Database Architecture & Optimization

## When to use
- Design database schemas and data models
- Select database technology (SQL, NoSQL, TimeSeries)
- Optimize slow queries and indexing
- Resolve N+1 query problems
- Plan database migrations
- Implement caching strategies
- Administer cloud databases

## Design
- Normalization vs denormalization tradeoffs
- Index design and covering indexes
- Partitioning and sharding strategies
- PostgreSQL: advanced types, JSONB, full-text search, extensions
- Schema migration with zero-downtime strategies

## Optimization
- EXPLAIN analysis and query planning
- Index optimization (B-tree, GIN, GiST, BRIN)
- N+1 detection and resolution
- Multi-tier caching (Redis, application, CDN)
- Connection pooling and load balancing

## Administration
- High availability and disaster recovery
- Backup and point-in-time recovery
- Monitoring and alerting
- Cloud database services (RDS, Cloud SQL, Cosmos DB)
- Cost optimization
