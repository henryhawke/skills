# Functional Programming

## When to use
- Write Haskell with advanced type-level programming
- Build Elixir/OTP applications
- Apply functional patterns in any language
- Design with algebraic data types
- Implement concurrency with message passing

## Haskell
- Advanced type system (GADTs, type families)
- Monad transformers and effects
- Pure functional architecture
- Concurrency with STM
- High-reliability software

## Elixir
- OTP patterns and supervision trees
- Phoenix LiveView
- GenServer and GenStage
- Distributed systems on BEAM
- Fault tolerance patterns
