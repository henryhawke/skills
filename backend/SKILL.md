# Backend Architecture & Development

## When to use
- Design REST, GraphQL, or gRPC APIs
- Build microservices with proper service boundaries
- Implement event-driven architectures
- Set up CQRS, event sourcing, saga patterns
- Build with FastAPI, Django, Express, Fastify
- Implement authentication and authorization

## Architecture patterns
- Clean Architecture / Hexagonal Architecture
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- CQRS and Event Sourcing
- Saga orchestration for distributed transactions
- API Gateway patterns
- Circuit breaker and retry patterns

## Frameworks
- Python: FastAPI (async), Django 5.x (DRF, Celery, Channels)
- Node.js: Express, Fastify
- GraphQL: Federation, subscriptions, caching
- gRPC: Protocol buffers, streaming

## Security
- Input validation at system boundaries
- OAuth2/OIDC authentication
- RBAC/ABAC authorization
- API rate limiting
- Secure by default patterns
