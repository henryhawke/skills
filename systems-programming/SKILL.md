description: "Use for Go (goroutines, channels, generics), Rust (async/Tokio, ownership, lifetimes), C++ (modern features, RAII, templates), and C (memory management, system calls, embedded) development. Covers concurrency patterns, memory safety, and performance optimization."

# Systems Programming

## When to use
- Write Go services with concurrency patterns
- Build Rust applications with async/Tokio
- Develop C++ with modern features
- Write C for systems/embedded
- Optimize performance-critical code
- Handle memory safety

## Go
- Goroutines, channels, sync primitives
- Context and cancellation
- Generics (Go 1.21+)
- Interface design
- Production microservices

## Rust
- Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes
- Async with Tokio and axum
- Error handling (Result, anyhow, thiserror)
- Unsafe code and FFI
- Performance optimization

## C++
- Modern C++ (C++17/20/23)
- RAII and smart pointers
- Move semantics and templates
- STL algorithms and containers
- Performance profiling

## C
- Memory management best practices
- System calls and POSIX
- Embedded systems patterns
- Kernel module development
